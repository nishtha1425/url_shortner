URL SHORTENER

The URL Shortener with Search Optimization project aims to develop a web application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that allows users to shorten long URLs into more manageable links. The application also includes a search feature, enabling users to search for specific URLs based on keywords. With this project, users can easily generate shortened URLs, access the original long URLs by entering the short code, and efficiently search for URLs using relevant keywords. It provides a user-friendly interface and utilizes the power of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to deliver a seamless and optimized URL shortening and search experience.

To run the URL Shortener with Search Optimization project, ensure you have Node.js installed. Clone or download the project files and navigate to the project directory in a terminal. Run npm install to install all dependencies specified in the package.json file, including Express and MongoDB. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. Start the server with node server.js. Access the web application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in a web browser. 

The project follows a simple yet effective internal working. When a user submits a long URL, the server generates a unique short code for it. This short code and the original long URL are stored in a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. When a user visits a shortened URL, the server retrieves the corresponding long URL from the database and performs a redirection to the original URL. For the search optimization feature, users can enter keywords to search for URLs. The server queries the database, looking for URLs that contain the specified keywords in their long URLs. The search results are then returned to the user. The project utilizes Node.js and Express to handle server-side logic, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose to model and interact with the data. This internal working ensures efficient URL shortening, retrieval, and searching operations, providing a seamless user experience.

Working on the project can provide valuable learning takeaways in full-stack development, web application architecture, database integration, search optimization, error handling, validation, and deployment. By engaging in this project, I was able to enhance my understanding of working with databases, optimizing search functionality, handling errors gracefully, validating user input, and deploying web applications.
